			  	<h5>Optimization theory is the language and toolset used to identify the <i>optimal</i> solution among all candidates for a given problem. Modeling a real-world problem using this language is an artform in and of itself. On SPConservation, we provide tools for solving optimization problems using a browser and the internet as a robust compute platform.</h5>
			  	
			  	<h5>One method for solving an optimization problem is to implement a related signal processing system endowed with an appropriate conservation principle. You can learn more about this approach <a ui-sref="opt.learn">here</a>. Specifically, for (most) optimization problems in the <a ui-sref="opt.examples">Examples library</a>, two <a href="" ng-click="currentPage=9">types of solvers</a> are available:</h5>

			  	<ul>
			  		<li><a href="" ng-click="currentPage=11">Local solvers</a>: signal processing systems organized into a single webpage for implementation. We provide  <a href="" ng-click="currentPage=11">four solvers</a> for local systems.</li>

			  		<li><a href="" ng-click="currentPage=13">Distributed solvers</a>: signal processing systems organized into a database (<a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>) which can be implemented using any number of <a href="" ng-click="currentPage=14">distributed workers.</a> We provide  <a href="" ng-click="currentPage=13">two solvers</a> for distributed systems.</li>

			  	</ul>

			  	<h5> Solving an optimization problem corresponds to running the associated signal processing system until it reaches a fixed-point. We provide both synchronous and asynchronous <a href="" ng-click="currentPage=6">implementation tools</a> to accomplish this.</h5>

			  	<h5>Check out the <a ui-sref="opt.examples">Examples library</a> to see various problems formulated using the language of optimization theory. Select one to solve the described problem by implementing the companion conservative signal processing structure yourself.</h5>

				<h3 class="opt-overview-header">Problem Formulation</h3>
				
				<h5 style="text-align:center"><span mathjax-bind="optFormulation"></span></h5>
				
				<h5> A typical description of an optimization problem is indicated above. We interpret the problem as follows:  <span mathjax-bind="x"></span> is a vector of decision variables, <span mathjax-bind="Q"></span> is the <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 3">utility or objective function</a> which we wish to minimize, and  <span mathjax-bind="X"></span> is the <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 4">feasible or constraint set</a>.  An optimization algorithm then seeks to identify the <span mathjax-bind="x"></span> from the set <span mathjax-bind="X"></span> which achieves the lowest value <span mathjax-bind="Qx"></span>.</h5>

				<h5>We chose the convention of minimizing a function in our definition. Maxamizing is trivially implemented by minimizing <span mathjax-bind="negQ"></span>.</h5>

			  	<h3 class="opt-overview-header">Utility Functions</h3>
			  	
			  	<h5 style="text-align:center"><span mathjax-bind="Q1"></span></h5>
				<h5>The utility or objective function maps every decision vector to a score or "preference." In the example above, consistent with many optimization formulations in practice, the utility function is seperable into the sum of many sub-utilities.</h5>
				
				<h5>Some commonly occuring utility functions:</h5>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-xs-4">
						<h5 style="text-align:center">
							<span mathjax-bind="Q2"></span>
						</h5>
						<h6>The utility function used in norm minimization and many forms of regression.</h6>

			  	<h5>The feasible set  <span mathjax-bind="X"></span>  describes all candidate solutions <span mathjax-bind="x"></span>  without any notion of preference among them. In the example above and consistent with many optimization formulations in practice, the overall constraint set <span mathjax-bind="X"></span> is described as an intersection of many sub-constraint sets <span mathjax-bind="Xk"></span>. The intersection is interpreted to mean that any feasible decision vector <span mathjax-bind="x"></span> is required to be a member of each of the sub-constraints.
			  	</h5>

			  	<h5>Some commonly occuring constraints sets:</h5>
			  	<ul>
			  		<li>Linear equality constraints: A hyper-plane is described by <span mathjax-bind="X1"></span></li>

			  		<li>Linear inequality constraints: A half-space is described by <span mathjax-bind="X2"></span> </li>

			  		<li>Multiplicative constraints: Two variables multiplied to produce a third is described by <span mathjax-bind="X3"></span></li>

			  		<li>General non-linear constraints: Two variables related through a function is described by <span mathjax-bind="X4"></span></li>

			  	<h3 class="opt-overview-header">Signal Processing</h3>
			  	<h5>Signal processing is the study of signals, systems, and their interactions. Signals are typicaly described using discrete or continuous functions while systems are described as the operators which process them. The applications of signal processing theory are endless; common ones include electrical engineering, seismology, audio processing, finance and economics.

			  	<h5>
			  	On SPConservation, we focus on the design and implementation of <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 7">conservative signal processing systems</a> represented using <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 6">signal-flow structures</a>.  The use of conservation is in linking the structure to an <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 2">optimization problem</a> in such a way that running the system to a fixed-point effectively solves the associated problem. We provide tools for two types of systems: <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 11">local or non-distributed</a> and <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 13">distributed</a> systems. For distributed systems, we decompose the signal-flow structure as well as the signal to be processed into objects and store them in a database so that a group of neworked <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 14">workers</a> can implement the system. For non-distributed systems, this process is performed completely within the browser

Signal-flow characterizations are behavioral in general and in this way can be thought of as a graphical declarative programming language.

					 	Conservation principles applied to optimization theory are used to define a primal and dual pair of optimization problems whose collective <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 4">constraints or feasibility conditions</a> serve as sufficient conditions for stationarity. Further, the conditions associated with this class of optimization problems can always be cast into the <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 7">conservative signal-flow structure</a> depicted on the top right. Using the system transformations mentioned <a href="" ng-click="currentPage = 7">here</a>, the signal-flow structure can be transformed to the structure on the bottom which has many advantages for implementation. You can learn more about these advantages <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0418" target="_blank">here</a>.
