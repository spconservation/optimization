A surprising number of problems in engineering and elsewhere can be formulated as minimizing a linear utility function over a convex feasible set described as a collection of half-spaces. Visit the <a ui-sref="opt.examples">Learn More</a>  page for a full description of how to solve a linear program asynchronously using the solver built into this page. In addition, <a href="http://www.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/aimms3om_linearprogrammingtricks.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> chapter overviews many tricks used to recast problems as linear programs. The Example Problem generated by this page is adapted from Example 3.5 in [1] and the default solver settings make use of filtered delays with a filter parameter of 0.5.
