The LASSO problem, aka Basis Pursuit Denoising or the Dantzig selector depending on your background, is a popular tool for uncovering sparse solutions when the number linear of measurements is much smaller than the number of variables. Typically, the measurement system needs to be certified via the restricted isometry property, a nullsapce property, or other coherence-like measures. The optimization problem setup is convex quadratic, and you'll see (at worst) linear convergence from this solver.
