Consider the recovery of a binary sequence which has been encoded using a linear system <span mathjax-bind="Alabel"></span> and transmitted over a noisy channel where the noise is additive, relatively sparse, and not necessarily Gaussian. A full description of this problem and the guarantees of recovery using linear programming can be found <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/DecodingLP.pdf" target="_blank">here<a/>. Moreover, the Example Problem in this page is adapted from <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/DecodingLP.pdf" target="_blank">here<a/> and specfically makes use of the discussed post-processing scheme for denoising via thresholding.
