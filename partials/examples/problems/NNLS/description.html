Least squares problems arise in many contexts and are often used for robust parameter estimation in applications such as statistics, signal processing, and curve fitting. In many of these settings, the parameters identified have physical consequences or interpretations (such as lengths) and so negative quantities don't make sense; even if they are "optimal." Thresholding them to zero is not necessarily the optimal non-negative solution and so the problem of non-negative least squares remedies this by identifying the least squares solution whose values are non-negative.
