The Basis Pursuit problem, close cousins with the Basis Pursuit Denoising or the LASSO problem depending on your background, is a popular tool for uncovering sparse solutions to a linear system of equations when the number  measurements is much smaller than the number of variables. Typically, the measurement system needs to be certified via by an isometry, nullspace, or coherence property as discussed in the compressed sensing literature. The problem formulation is a linear programming problem and so it would be wise to use a filtered solver.
